A group can usually be represented as a matrix.
One kind of groups swaps items around like this:

    1 -> 2
    2 -> 1
    3 -> 3

To write this a matrix, you need to fill inn zeroes.
Read the matrix as input goes into the top and output goes to left in each row.

    0 1 0
    1 0 0
    0 0 1

A matrix product of square matrices is written in my calculator syntax as a triple multiplication.

    A *** B
